# OSC
This repository is developed during the seminar Hot Topics in Communication Systems at the TU Berlin. The goal is to investigate how Open Sound Control (OSC) can be implemented on different hardware with as few barriers as possible. Initially OSC was designed for realtime music performances, it will be investigated which limits and possibilities OSC has outside the music domain.
